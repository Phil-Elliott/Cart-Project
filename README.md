# Cart-Project

## Email 1

Hello Client, 

I have just looked over all of the material and requirements for the React based cart/checkout process. I should be able to complete everything within five hours.  I will however need a few more things from the UI team. I have included the list below. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. 

- A section for the customers billing and shipping details.
- A payment method section.
- A return to cart button from the checkout section.

Thanks, 
Phil Elliott
